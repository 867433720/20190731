# Neural-Machine-Translation-using-Keras
This is the sequential Encoder-Decoder implementation of Neural Machine Translation using Keras. This model translates the input German sentence into the corresponding English sentence with a **Bleu Score: 0.509124** on the test set.

**Encoder** - Represents the input text corpus (Routing IP record ) in the form of embedding vectors and trains the model.

**Decoder** - Translates and predicts the input embedding vectors into one-hot vectors representing Input Destination IP record.

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda that resolves all the required dependencies for Machine Learning.
